          I am a Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in web
          development, particularly in front-end development using React.js. I
          build responsive, scalable web applications and transform traditional
          websites into modern, React-based versions. My skills include clean
          code architecture, reusable components, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and
          Email.js integration expertise. I am passionate about learning new
          technologies and taking on projects that challenge my skills.
